This program combines the previous five programming assignments into one program.
It takes in a text file from the representative's website and processes it into InfoSets.
An InfoSet is a class with a String title and String[] facts, which are used to help answer users' queries.
Once the data is processed, the user can then input queries and receive information according to their query.
The program uses Levenshtein distance to match misspelled queries to the intended query.
When the user wishes to quit, they type quit (or something close) and the program ends.
Whenever the user inputs a query or the system outputs anything, a corresponding chat file is updated in the data/chat_sessions subdirectory.
Once the program ends, the chat_statistics.csv file is updated with the statistics from the session.
If a user wishes to view overall statistics, a specific chat's statistics, or a chatlog, they can use command arguments (-summary, -showchat-summary, -showchat) respectively.
