This program takes an input file named input.txt located in the data folder.
Example input.txt:
Rectangle 4 5
Circle 3
Triangle 6 7 8
Example output.txt for that input.txt: 
Rectangle area: 20
Circle area: 28.2735
Triangle area: 20.3332
The order and spacing matter.
The program goes through each line and creates a object for each shape using vectors populated from the file
The measurements are calculated and printed both to the console and output.txt.
If a shape does not have enough measurements, it notifies the user and does not calculate anything.
It handles missing inputs and non-number inputs.
Running the program with a command argument besides 1 or 2 will immediately end the program.

The code is longer now than it was before, since I have many more files than I had before. However, adding a new functionality to my program will be much easier than my
non-object-oriented program since I can easily create a new method for my classes.
