This program takes an input file named input.txt located in the data folder.
Example input.txt:
Rectangle 4 5
Circle 3
Triangle 6 7 8
The order and spacing matter.
The program goes through each line and creates an array for the rectangle and triangle, but the circle only
has one measurement so it just has a radius variable.
The measurements are calculated and printed both to the console and output.txt.
If a shape does not have enough measurements, it notifies the user and does not calculate anything.
Dynamic memory management is used to store the sides.
Running the program with a command argument besides 1 or 2 will immediately end the program.
