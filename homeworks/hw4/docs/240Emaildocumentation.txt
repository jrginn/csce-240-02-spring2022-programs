This program takes two arguments: the type of header and the type of the value being searched.
The program instantly quits if there is an incorrect amount of arguments or a first argument not equal to "Gmail" or "Outlook".
The respective file is selected and each line is put into a vector, which is then put into the respective constructor.
The object then searches for the second argument, and it returns the value of the matching type if it is in the header.
