This program takes one or two integer inputs.
If one input is given, its factorial is printed out.
If two inputs are given, it prints out the number of ways the second number of items can be selected from
a set of the first number of items.
The factorial function is recursive. Its exit condition is when its parameter x is less than or equal to 1,
where it then returns 1. Otherwise, it returns x * factorial(x-1).
The combination function uses the factorial function, where it divides the factorial of the larger number by
the product of the factorial of the smaller number and the factorial of the larger number minus the smaller.
The program will immediately stop if a negative number is passed, an argument is not a number, or if a
number larger than 20 is an argument.
The program keeps track of how long the operation performed takes and prints it out.

Examples:

Input: 5
Output: 120
		Time in seconds: 5.0832e-05

Input: 6 2
Output: 15
		Time in seconds: 4.9151e-05
