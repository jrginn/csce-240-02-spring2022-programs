Summary        
This program takes a formatted text file called “hixonOutput.txt” in the data subdirectory. It takes a command line argument formatted in one of two ways, where it is either just a general content title or it is the title, a colon, and then a more specific part of the content under the title. An example would be “Personal Information:Fireman”. The program reads through the file and creates a formatted string by adding a delimiter string whenever there is an empty line. The formatted string is then split based on the delimiter, and an array of InfoSets is created with the same length as the split string array. The program then puts each string into the constructor of the InfoSet to fill the InfoSet array. An info set has a title string and a string array called facts. The InfoSet object takes a tab delimited string as its only parameter for the constructor and splits it based on tabs. If the split array is length 1, then the title is the entire string and the facts array is null. Otherwise, the first element is the title and the other elements are put into the facts array. The class has accessor methods and a toString() method. Once the array is filled, it is then passed into the checkRequest method. That method takes the command argument and InfoSet array as parameters and has two behaviors depending on if the argument is split by a colon or not. If it is, then it checks each InfoSet title for a match to the part before the colon using regex. If it finds a match, it prints the title and then checks each fact from that InfoSet for the part after the colon using regex. If a fact matching the second part is found, then it is printed again. If there is no colon, then the program only checks the titles for the whole argument. The entire InfoSet is printed if a title matches. Once the request is checked, the scanners are closed and the program ends.
