Summary
This program takes in a “sets.ser” file, which is a serialized form of the InfoSet array generated in the DataProcessor program. 
The program deserializes this file into an InfoSet array, where it handles IOExceptions and ClassNotFoundExceptions. 
Assuming there are no issues, the program then welcomes the user and asks what questions they have about Representative Hixon. 
The program then starts an infinite loop. At the beginning of the loop, the program takes a string from the user’s input. 
It checks if the string is either “quit” or “q” (case insensitive), and if it is then the loop immediately breaks. 
Otherwise, the string is passed into the checkRequest method along with the array of InfoSets. 
The method contains a boolean variable “found”, which is false by default and is set to true whenever the request matches a value. 
This method first checks the request against all of the titles in the InfoSet array. 
It utilizes regular expressions, where each title is the pattern and it checks if the request matches each title. 
If it does match, found is set to true and the title and its corresponding facts are printed. 
It then loops through each facts array in the InfoSets array and checks for matches similarly. 
If the found boolean is still false, then it goes through each title and splits it by spaces. 
It then checks each word (four characters or longer) against the request and when a match occurs it prints the title and its facts and found is set to true. 
If found is still false, then it splits each fact of each InfoSet and checks each word against the request. 
If a match is found, then it prints the fact and sets found to true. 
The method then ends by returning found. 
Back in the main method, the method checks if the returned found value is true or false. 
If it is false, the program prints “I cannot handle that query.” 
Once the loop is done, the user is thanked and the program ends.
