Summary
This program uses a “chat_statistics.csv” file and a directory of chat files which are .txts. 
The program takes one of three arguments: “-summary”, “-showchat”, and “-showchat-summary”. 
The last two require an additional number after the argument so that the program knows which chat to show or summarize. 
If there are no arguments given, the program notifies the user and ends the program. 
Otherwise, the program checks if the first argument matches. 
First, it checks if the argument is “-summary”. 
If it is, it runs the summarizeAll method using the chat_statistics file. 
This method goes through each line with data and totals each data point across all of the chats. 
It then prints the data compiled about the chats. 
If that is not the argument given, then it checks if it is “-showchat”. 
If it is, it then attempts to get the number chat to look for as the second argument, and if there is no second argument then the program ends. 
If there is, then the method showchat is run using the statistics file and the index given by the second argument. 
The program loops through the statistics file and checks for the chat matching the index.
 If there is one, the found boolean is updated and that chat’s filename is stored. 
 If it finds the chat, it then goes through each line of that chat and prints it. 
 Otherwise, it tells the user that the chat does not exist. 
 Finally, it checks if the argument is “-showchat-summary”. 
 If it is, then it checks for a second argument similarly to the “-showchat” check. 
 If there is a second argument, then it runs the summarizeSpecific method with the statistics file and index parameters. 
 This method is similar to summarizeAll, but it only stores the specific chat’s data rather than all of the chats’ data. 
 It then prints that data. 
 If the first argument is none of these, then it tells the user that the argument is invalid.
